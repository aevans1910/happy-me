# HappyMe 

## Motivation

I wanted to make a blog site where individuals with mental health issues could go to get advice. At this early on prototyping stage, there are still no users so the data that is curently on the website has been sourced from already exsiting mental health blogers. The source to their work in linked in each post.

## Where this is now

This website is curently a fullstack website with working form and user authentication. However, there is yet to be a real user base.

## Running the code

To run this code one would need to first clone the project into their own machine, and then travel to the inside folder of this project at the same level as the manage.py folder, and then run python manage.py runserver in their terminal.

## Code structure

- Templates were used to create structure
- Bootstrap was used for styling
- The structure of the website was made with Django
